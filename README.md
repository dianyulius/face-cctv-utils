# Face CCTV - Utility Scripts

Public repository for Face CCTV utility scripts and client deployment tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

### fix_service.sh

**Purpose:** Fix Face CCTV systemd service file for Spy Pen hotspot support

**Issue:** Older installations have `NoNewPrivileges=true` which blocks WiFi hotspot management via `sudo nmcli`.

**Solution:** This script automatically:
- ‚úÖ Removes the NoNewPrivileges restriction
- ‚úÖ Creates timestamped backup of service file
- ‚úÖ Validates the fix was applied correctly
- ‚úÖ Restarts the service automatically
- ‚úÖ Shows service status after fix

**Usage:**

```bash
# One-liner (download and execute):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dianyulius/face-cctv-utils/main/fix_service.sh | sudo bash

# Or download first, then execute:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dianyulius/face-cctv-utils/main/fix_service.sh
sudo bash fix_service.sh
```

**Safe to run:**
- ‚úÖ Idempotent (can run multiple times safely)
- ‚úÖ Creates backup before making changes
- ‚úÖ Validates fix was applied
- ‚úÖ Restores backup if validation fails
- ‚úÖ Skip if already fixed

**Requirements:**
- Root/sudo access
- Face CCTV installed at `/etc/systemd/system/face_cctv.service`

**What it changes:**

```diff
# Before:
- NoNewPrivileges=true

# After:
+ # NoNewPrivileges disabled to allow nmcli/sudo for Spy Pen hotspot management
```
